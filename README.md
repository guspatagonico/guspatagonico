# Hi there 👋 I'm Gustavo Salvini

Welcome to my digital playground!

I'm a Web Developer, IT Consultant, and Founder of [EcimTech](https://ecimtech.com), passionate about building tailored web solutions that drive growth, innovation, and transformation.

Here, I explore full-stack web technologies, experiment with open-source projects, and share what I learn along the way.  
I believe in the perks of sharing knowledge: **building, learning, evolving**.

## 🔥 What I Do
- 🚀 Building purpose-driven digital products with a focus on quality, scalability, and impact.
- ⚙️ Consulting on IT strategy and digital solutions architecture with discipline and business insight.
- 🌐 Developing full-stack web applications (Next.js, React, Node.js) through clean, scalable, and future-ready practices.
- 🛠️ Innovating through open-source experimentation and contribution.
- 📚 Sharing knowledge to fuel growth, excellence, and collective innovation.

## 🤖 AI-Enhanced Development and Research

I'm actively researching and developing solutions that leverage **AI and LLM technologies** to enhance software development workflows, product ideation, and digital solutions.

My work includes:
- Integrating **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **Gemini** and **open-source LLMs** through API-based architectures.
- Exploring **Generative AI** applications for software architecture support, content generation, and automation.
- Building **AI-augmented web tools** that empower users to create, learn, and make better decisions faster.
- Researching **RAG systems** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and **semantic search** integrations to improve the way information is accessed and used inside applications.
- Investigating **local LLM deployment** options for privacy-centric AI solutions.

I see AI not just as a tool, but as a catalyst for **building smarter, more scalable, and more human-centered digital products**.
